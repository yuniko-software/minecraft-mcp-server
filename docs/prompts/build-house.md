# I'll help you build a complete house! Here's a comprehensive step-by-step approach

## Phase 1: Planning and Foundation

1. **Choose location**: Find a flat area or clear one using `/fill` commands
2. **Plan dimensions**: Decide on house size (e.g., 15x15 for a medium house)
3. **Create foundation**: Use stone blocks for durability
   - `/fill ~-7 ~-1 ~-7 ~7 ~-1 ~7 stone`

## Phase 2: Basic Structure

1. **Build walls**: Use logs for corners, planks for walls
   - `/fill ~-7 ~0 ~-7 ~-7 ~3 ~7 oak_log` (corners)
   - `/fill ~-6 ~0 ~-7 ~6 ~3 ~-7 oak_planks` (walls)
2. **Add floor**: Wooden planks for interior flooring
   - `/fill ~-6 ~0 ~-6 ~6 ~0 ~6 oak_planks`
