# Here are essential command optimization techniques

## Command Efficiency Tips

### 1. Use Relative Coordinates

- `~` for relative positioning: `/fill ~-5 ~0 ~-5 ~5 ~3 ~5 stone`
- `^` for local coordinates: `/setblock ^2 ^0 ^0 torch`
- More flexible and reusable

### 2. Batch Operations

- Use `/fill` instead of multiple `/setblock` commands
- Group similar operations together
- Plan command sequences in advance

### 3. Target Selectors

- `@p` (nearest player), `@a` (all players), `@e` (all entities)
- `@e[type=zombie,distance=..10]` for specific targeting
- Use `limit=1` to prevent unexpected results

## Performance Optimization

### 4. Limit Command Scope

```minecraft
# Good: Specific area
/fill ~-10 ~-5 ~-10 ~10 ~10 ~10 air

# Avoid: Massive areas
/fill -1000 0 -1000 1000 255 1000 air
```

### 5. Use Appropriate Commands

- `/clone` for copying structures
- `/structure` for complex builds
- `/worldborder` instead of manual barriers

### 6. Command Block Optimization

- Use conditional execution
- Minimize always-active blocks
- Use pulse mode when possible

## Safety and Testing

### 7. Test in Creative Mode

- Always test destructive commands first
- Use `/gamemode creative` for testing
- Keep backups of important builds

### 8. Use Undo Strategies

- Remember exact coordinates for reversal
- Take screenshots before major changes
- Save structures before modifications
