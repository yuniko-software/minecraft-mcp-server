# Let me help you debug command issues systematically

## Common Command Problems

### 1. Syntax Errors

**Check these first:**

- Spelling: `/setblock` not `/setblokc`
- Coordinates: Valid numbers, not missing values
- Block IDs: `stone` not `stones`
- Brackets: Proper `[]` usage for block states

### 2. Permission Issues

- Ensure you have operator status: `/op [username]`
- Check if commands are enabled in server settings
- Verify command blocks are enabled

### 3. Coordinate Problems

```minecraft
# Check your position first
/tp @p ~ ~ ~

# Test with absolute coordinates
/setblock 100 64 100 stone

# Then try relative coordinates
/setblock ~0 ~1 ~0 stone
```

## Debugging Strategies

### 4. Step-by-Step Testing

```minecraft
# Test basic command first
/setblock ~0 ~1 ~0 stone

# Then add complexity
/setblock ~0 ~1 ~0 oak_stairs[facing=north]

# Finally, full command
/fill ~-5 ~0 ~-5 ~5 ~3 ~5 oak_stairs[facing=north]
```

### 5. Common Block State Issues

- Check valid states: `/setblock ~0 ~1 ~0 oak_stairs[facing=north]`
- Not: `oak_stairs[direction=north]` (wrong property name)
- Use F3 debug screen to see block states

### 6. Area and Range Limits

- Commands have execution limits
- Break large operations into smaller chunks
- Check world border constraints

## Server-Specific Debugging

### 7. Server Log Analysis

- Check console for error messages
- Look for "Unknown command" or "Invalid syntax"
- Monitor server performance during commands

### 8. Connection Issues

- Verify RCON connection if using remote commands
- Check server response time
- Ensure proper authentication
